# Neural-network-to-detect-change
This class is based on a simple model of neural network.
The model is the recognition of sound by the human ear.
This class that can be used to recognize changes over time in human nerves.
To simulate the human optic nerve, one class is required per pixel.

A class used to check the operation of a manual controller used in the factory. 
You can check the operation of the machine by the input of the microphone closely connected to the machine.
This is a function that like the human ear move in much the same way as picking up the desired sound.

 EX.Image is neural network being used.
